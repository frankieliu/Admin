# Stage manager toggle:

1. Control Center (next to the date on top right)
2. Click on :[] icon


I just discovered that there is an option to set a shortcut key to toggle stage manager off and on.

It’s in:

Mac settings,
keyboard section,
Keyboard Shortcuts
Mission Control
I set mine to F3 which - on my keyboard - is the same key you press to get mission control, but with the function key held down - (which makes it easier for me to remember).

Hope this helps - I was under the impression this wasn’t possible.
