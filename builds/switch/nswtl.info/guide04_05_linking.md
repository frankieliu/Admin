Some games, such as NES Online or the latest versions of Mortal Kombat 11, require a Nintendo Account to be linked to the console. The linking process is verified, so it doesn't matter whether you're online or offline—the game will check for the link and refuse to run if it doesn't find a linked account on the console. If your console hasn't yet been flashed and is running the official firmware with system software version 20.4.0, or you don't care about the increased risk of being banned, you can simply link your account by logging into the eShop. If you're already banned, have been flashed, or simply don't want to use the console online, the method described below will work for you.

ATTENTION!! Don't ignore the need to create a backup ! There's always a chance that something could go wrong and your console will stop loading! BE SURE to back up your saves from all your accounts!
