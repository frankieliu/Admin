# Preparing to run custom firmware via Fusée Gelée
In this section, we'll put the theoretical knowledge gained last time to practical use. Each step is essential if you want to get the most out of your console's firmware. Each step is self-contained. If for some reason you haven't completed any of them yet, you can come back to them later.

# Installing firmware on EmuNAND
1. Installing and running Kefir [kefir](./guide05_01_kefir.md)
2. NAND backup [nand](./guide06_01_nand.md)
3. Creation of EmuNAND [create](./guide07_01_install_emunand.md)
4. Updating SysNAND to the recommended system firmware version [safe](./guide04_04_safe_fw.md)
5. Account linking is the final touch. Some games require account linking to work. [link](./guide04_05_linking.md)
6. The launch of the games is the final part, for which everything was done [install](./guide04_06_install_games.md)
7. Using an already flashed console [already](./guide08_01_already_flashed.md)

Now you can use EmuNAND for pirated games and SysNAND for licensed games.

# Flashing firmware without EmuNAND (not recommended)
You won't be able to use online even in purchased games until you migrate SysNAND to EmuNAND ▼ According to these instructions [emuNand](./guide04_02_transition_to_emunand.md), you won't be able to restore a clean backup to SysNAND.

 ▼ EmuNAND A complete copy of the NAND flash memory located on the memory card. This is used to leave the official firmware as untouched as possible. For example, you can play pirated EmuNAND while using the stock firmware (the original firmware located in the console's internal memory) for online play and purchased games. This minimizes the chance of getting banned.

1. Launching custom firmware [custom](./guide04_03_custom_fw.md)
2. Updating SysNAND to the recommended system firmware version [safe](./guide04_04_safe_fw.md)
3. Account linking is the final touch. Some games require account linking to work. [linking](./guide04_05_linking.md)
4. The launch of the games is the final part, for which everything was done [install](./guide04_06_install_games.md)
