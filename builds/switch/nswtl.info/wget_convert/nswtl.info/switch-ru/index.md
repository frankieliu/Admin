Currently, **all** Nintendo Switch family consoles can be hacked. However, depending on the console revision and the presence of certain vulnerabilities, hacking methods may differ. Therefore, the primary task is to determine which specific method suits you.

## Types of Hacks

### [Fusée Gelée](fusee-gelee.md)

This type of hack can only be used on consoles released before summer 2018. Although after this period consoles were released on the exact same hardware platform, the vulnerability was closed. If you don't know whether your console is vulnerable to the Fusée Gelée method, you'll find a helper below to select the vulnerability type by serial number.

### [Caffeine](preparation-caffeine.md)

With this type of hack, you can hack any Nintendo Switch with system software version 4.0.0 - 4.1.0. This is a software vulnerability tied to a specific system software version that only works on it.

### [Modchipping](modchip.md)

With modchipping, you can hack absolutely any Nintendo Switch. Chips on the **Mariko** platform can only be hacked with modchips. (The codeword **Mariko** designates second revision consoles (the second letter in the serial number is a consonant, e.g., XK* or XJ*), as well as Switch Lite and OLED. They are built on a new process, giving them better battery life (larger switches). They can be hacked **only** by modchipping.) First revision consoles with a closed vulnerability and firmware above 4.1.0 can also only be hacked by modchipping.
