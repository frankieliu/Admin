RCM Loaders are convenient devices for injecting payloads into your Nintendo Switch without needing a computer. They make hacking more portable and user-friendly.

## What is RCM?

RCM (Recovery Mode) is the Nintendo Switch's recovery mode that allows payload injection through USB connection. RCM loaders automate this process.
