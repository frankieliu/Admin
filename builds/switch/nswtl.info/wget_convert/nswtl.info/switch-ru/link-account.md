Account linking allows you to use your Nintendo account on a hacked console while minimizing ban risks through proper isolation.

## Before You Begin

⚠️ **Important**: There is always a risk when linking accounts on hacked consoles. Follow all precautions carefully.

### Requirements

- Clean SysNAND (optional but recommended)
- EmuNAND setup
- DNS blocking (90DNS)
- Separate Nintendo account for hacking

## Safety Precautions

### 1. Use Separate Accounts

Create a dedicated Nintendo account for hacking:
- **Primary account**: For official console use
- **Hacking account**: For hacked console only

### 2. Environment Isolation

- **SysNAND**: Keep clean for official use
- **EmuNAND**: Use for hacking and piracy

### 3. DNS Protection

Use 90DNS or Incognito to block Nintendo telemetry:
- Primary DNS: `163.172.141.219`
- Secondary DNS: `45.248.48.62`

## Linking Process

### Method 1: Fresh Console

1. **Prepare console**:
   - Install [KEFIR](kefir.md)
   - Set up [EmuNAND](emunand.md)
   - Configure DNS blocking

2. **Create new account**:
   - Boot into EmuNAND
   - Go to System Settings → Users
   - Create new user
   - Link new Nintendo account

3. **Test functionality**:
   - Access eShop
   - Download updates
   - Test online features

### Method 2: Existing Console

1. **Backup saves**:
   - Use [JKSV](backup-saves.md)
   - Back up all game saves
   - Store safely on PC

2. **Create EmuNAND**:
   - Follow [EmuNAND guide](emunand.md)
   - Set up clean environment
   - Configure properly

3. **Link account in EmuNAND**:
   - Boot into EmuNAND
   - Link Nintendo account
   - Verify it works

## Best Practices

### Account Management

- **Don't mix accounts** between SysNAND and EmuNAND
- **Use different email** for hacking account
- **Avoid purchasing** games on hacked account
- **Keep purchases** on clean console

### Network Safety

- **Always use DNS blocking**
- **Avoid official servers** with pirated games
- **Keep offline** when not needed
- **Monitor for bans**

### Save Management

- **Backup regularly**:
  ```
  Before online use → Backup saves
  Use online features
  After online use → Backup again
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Link Account

**Error messages**:
- Check DNS settings
- Verify internet connection
- Try different account
- Check server status

**Missing options**:
- Ensure proper firmware version
- Check regional restrictions
- Verify account age
- Try account creation on console

### Account Suspended

If account gets suspended:
1. Don't panic
2. Contact Nintendo support
3. Create new account
4. Use more caution next time

## Advanced Options

### Multiple EmuNANDs

- **Gaming EmuNAND**: For pirated games
- **Online EmuNAND**: For legitimate purchases
- **Testing EmuNAND**: For experiments

### Incognito Mode

Alternative to DNS blocking:
- Runs in EmuNAND
- Blocks telemetry at system level
- More thorough protection

### Emulators

Use emulators for older games:
- No account needed
- No online features
- Completely safe

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Activities

- **Single-player games**
- **Homebrew applications**
- **Emulators**
- **Media consumption**

### High Risk Activities

- **Online play with pirated games**
- **eShop purchases on hacked console**
- **Mixing official and pirated content**
- **Multiple account linking**

## Recovery

If Banned:

1. **Console ban**:
   - Create new Nintendo account
   - Use different console
   - Current console cannot be unbanned

2. **Account ban**:
   - Create new Nintendo account
   - Use different email
   - Console may still work

## Recommendations

### For Beginners

1. **Don't link accounts** initially
2. **Learn without online**
3. **Understand risks first**
4. **Consider clean console for official use**

### For Advanced Users

1. **Use proper isolation**
2. **Maintain backups**
3. **Monitor for bans**
4. **Keep purchases separate**

A: Risk exists. Follow precautions to minimize.
