## General Information

Currently, chipping is the only way to hack **Mariko**-based Switches or patched Erista, meaning all consoles not vulnerable to hacking via Fusée Gelée, as well as Switch Lite.

**Mariko** refers to second revision consoles (the second letter in the serial number is a consonant, like XK* or XJ*), as well as Switch Lite and OLED. They are built on a new process, giving them better battery life (larger switches). They can be hacked **only** by chipping.

Chipping is hardware hacking. That is, chip installation is done by soldering it to the console's motherboard. Therefore, if your console still has an official warranty, you will void it by installing a chip.

The system software version of your console doesn't matter.

## How to Install a Chip in Your Console?

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Chipping requires confident soldering skills. Don't risk it and give your console to a professional for chipping, or buy an already chipped one!
>
> If you still decide to do it yourself, follow [these instructions](preparation-modchip.md)

## Will Online Work?

A hacked console can contain both custom and official firmware. In custom firmware, you only have access to local online, between two consoles, or pirate online. However, by switching to official firmware, you can use regular online. Don't forget that online will only work for officially downloaded or purchased games.

## What Memory Card to Choose for a Hacked Console?

A card from a normal, well-known brand, bought not in a basement but in a reputable store, class no lower than U1. After purchase, be sure to check the card for authenticity.
