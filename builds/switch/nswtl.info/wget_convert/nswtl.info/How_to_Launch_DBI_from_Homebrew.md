## Troubleshooting Homebrew Access

### **If Homebrew Launcher Won't Open:**

#### **Check CFW Status:**
1. **Verify CFW is running**: Go to System Settings → System

3. **If not showing**: You may be in stock firmware, not CFW

#### **Try Alternative Method:**
1. **Hold R + Album**: Some setups use R instead of L
2. **Try X + Album**: Alternative button combination
3. **Check for updates**: May need updated homebrew launcher

### **If DBI Doesn't Appear in List:**

#### **Check Installation:**
1. **Verify KEFIR install**: DBI should be included
2. **Check /switch/ folder**: DBI should be in `/switch/DBI/`
3. **Reinstall if needed**: Download latest KEFIR

#### **Manual DBI Installation:**
1. **Download latest DBI**: From [GitHub releases](https://github.com/rashevskyv/dbi/releases)
2. **Extract to SD card**: Place in `/switch/DBI/` folder
