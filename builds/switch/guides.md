## Questions
1. I would like to switch to HATS
   1. if emummc is on the sd then you can install HATS
   2. how do you know you have emummc: on hekate reboot, then OFW, if switch boots up and none of your pirated games are there then you are good
2. I would like to install using backups
   1. guides when you need back-ups that were created
   2. there is restore eMMC in Hekate
      1. never took the risk to use it, instead user ran eMMC Boot0 and eMMC Raw GPP
3. How do I back up my games on CFW - so can run on PC/Steam
   1. Follow beginners guide to get CFW running
   2. Dump prodkeys using lockpickrm (under payloads in hekate) 
   3. Launch CFW SYSMMC and open DBI from homebrew menu
   4. Select "run mtp responder"
   5. Plug switch into computer and it will pop up as a drive with folders
   6. Copy the games and saves to your computer from the "installed games" and "game saves" folder
4. Retroarch
   1. Open homebrew menu
   2. Go to homebrew store and download retroarch
   3. Run it via title override (Hold R while launching any playable game or app)
   4. Select retroarch from the homebrew menu
   5. Navigate to settings and download all the new assets and cores that you like
   6. Restart the app
   7. Add the roms on  your sd
   8. Scan the path in retroarch to add it to your library
   9. Download roms from ghosteshop and add it to home screen
5. Dump all my save data, games, decryption keys
   1. Follow the beginner's guide except don't create an emummc
   2. Dump your prod.keys using lockpickrm (under payloads in hekate)
   3. Launch CFW SYSMMC
   4. Open DBI
   5. Run MTP Responder
   6. Plug Switch to a computer
   7. Drag and Drop the saves and games you want
6. Extract HATS pack zip to the root of the sd card
   1. When you inject hekate it loads from the sd card
   2. If it doesn't find files it loads a very limited version
7. You have to inject the payload everytime you power it on
