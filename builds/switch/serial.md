1. Hekate - bootloader
1. Atmosphere - cfw (custom firmware)

# Formats
Atmosphere custom firmware for the Nintendo Switch primarily works with game files in the following formats:
- .NSP (Nintendo Switch Package): This is the preferred format for installing digital games and their updates or DLC. It's similar to how you would install a game from the eShop.
- .XCI (NX Card Image): This format is for dumped game cartridges. While Atmosphere can work with XCI files, it's generally recommended to convert them to NSP for easier installation and management, especially since updates and DLC can be combined into a single NSP file. 

# Conversion

I've had success with this

https://github.com/dezem/SAK

Just need to make sure you have a fully populated keys.dat file you can get from lockpick RCM (well rename it and place in the folder called bin in the SAK folder)

https://github.com/shchmue/Lockpick_RCM

Lockpick allows you to extract console's encryption key

Lockpick is a firmware that allows you to extract your console's encryption keys. It is included in the HATS package by Stethix (YouTuber). It includes all that you need to boot into Hekate and have the tools that you need to run custom firmware.

I use this method from eradicatinglove's youtube channel. By far the easiest to follow and it works great.

Mounting I don’t know...

But Tinfoil let you install XCI file from USB using Nut 2.50.

You can download it from the download section on their website. https://tinfoil.io/Download

Use nxdumptool to directly dump as NSP. That's what I do. What's the advantages of XCI anyways?

These Were the 20 Best Nintendo Switch Exclusives

Best Nintendo Switch Exclusive Games
Best Nintendo Switch Exclusive Games

"Super Mario Odyssey" (Nintendo)
Coming off the disappointing Wii U era, Nintendo needed a win in a big way—and it got it with the Switch console, which has become Nintendo's best-selling piece of hardware ever. But after eight years the reign of the Nintendo Switch is coming to an end as the company prepares to launch its successor, the Switch 2, in early June. So now is the right time to reflect on the games that helped make the Nintendo Switch such a massive success.

While it would be easy to simply credit the Switch's success to its unique form factor—that it works both as a console for your living room and as a portable you can take with you—it's the system's strong lineup of games, in particular its exclusives, that put the Switch over the top. So let's look back at the 20 best Nintendo Switch exclusive games from that console's lifetime, as ranked by Metascore (representing the consensus views of top game publications on a 0-100 scale). Note that only games with at least seven reviews were eligible for inclusion here.

While the hack-n-slash Bayonetta series has always been ridiculous and all the way over the top, Platinum Games still managed to kick things up a few notches with this trilogy capper in which the title character—a cosmic witch from hell—must travel the multiverse and team up with alternate versions of herself in order to save reality. While not everyone loved the direction the story took, critics were generally just as smitten with Bayonetta's signature free-flowing combat this time as they were with the first two games.

"Featuring giant demon battles, massive destruction, and flexible combat that encourages creative fighting, the long-awaited Bayonetta 3 is the witch's biggest action romp yet." —Jordan Minor, PCMag

Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition (2025)

Originally a Wii U title that never got its chance to shine, this survival-oriented spinoff from the mainline Xenoblade Chronicles series got quite an upgrade on Switch a decade after its original release. This new, remastered edition of Xenoblade Chronicles X includes plenty of new content, including improved visuals and gameplay, a more modern UI, and lots of new characters and pieces of storytelling. But it's the game's massive and compelling open world—larger than that of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild—that continues to impress critics despite the fact that it shows its age in other ways.

"If you're a fan of JRPGs or looking to dip your feet in, Xenoblade Chronicles X's Definitive release on the Switch is an excellent start and comes back boasting new features, new content, and updated quality of life to truly make it worth your while. It is an absolute gem and is a game to keep on your radar, even if the story leaves a little to be desired." —Braden Czerwinski, Gaming Age

Nintendo took this gem that was originally released on the Game Boy in 1993 and gave it the full remake treatment, preserving the top-down style of the game, incorporating elements from the Game Boy Color re-release from 1998, and otherwise amping up every aspect of the previously obscure title for the Switch. There was plenty of nostalgic enthusiasm for the Link's Awakening remake among critics, both for being a faithful recreation of a classic and because it's a fairly unique experience in the present. That said, there were also plenty of complaints about technical issues, though some of those problems have since been addressed with updates.

"It's a beautiful retread, capturing the toy-town essence of one of Link's most obscure and off-the-wall adventures in his history." —Sam White, British GQ

Despite coming out a decade after the third game in the series, which itself was released nine years after its predecessor—this is not the sort of franchise that gestates quickly, it seems—Pikmin 4 doesn't reinvent the wheel. It simply takes the franchise's strategy/puzzle gameplay, in which you command your army of tiny guys to explore, collect stuff, and solve any puzzles that might prevent you from doing the other two things, and refines it into a more modern experience. While the title was very well liked by critics, the level of enthusiasm tended to vary by how much they enjoyed its vibe.

"Pikmin 4 breathes new life into a franchise that was starting to feel lost to time, welcoming new players into a well-loved yet underrated Nintendo series, while simultaneously reminding older players as to exactly why they fell in love with the goofy world of Pikmin in the first place." —Kara Philips, TechRadar

# 16: Astral Chain (2019)

Astral Chain (2019)

Platinum Games, the developer behind the Bayonetta franchise, brought its signature hack-and-slash gameplay to this original title and mixed it with something new: detective-style investigations. Players take on the role of a magical police officer in the Ark, the last city on Earth in a dark, apocalyptic future, and must use both their mental and physical skills to stop a massive conspiracy that threatens everyone's safety. While some critics felt that Platinum tried too many different things with Astral Chain, like the demonic pet you have to take care of throughout the story, the core experience—the studio's signature action gameplay—was still good enough to override most of those complaints.

"Astral Chain is loud, brash, exciting, and, in the end, a warning about the dangers of unquestioned loyalty. Its hyperkinetic action sequences and colorful characters might make the game seem like it isn't interested in offering more than intricately designed fights and a straightforward genre story, but stick around for its entirety and its cast of 2070s police officers show themselves to be more than just cartoon cut-outs of sci-fi cops." —EGM

This remake of a beloved RPG title from the GameCube era—in which Mario and the other characters are drawings on a piece of paper and are, therefore, physically flat—is largely a quality-of-life update. It features much-improved graphics and animations plus a pile of low-key changes that reduce some of the friction from the original version. While critics appreciated how well this remake preserves the essence of the original experience, there was some grumbling about the tedium of the turn-based combat systems. As a result, there's a bit more spread in the review scores for this title than there is with most of the other games on this list.

"Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is irresistible for nostalgic gamers and Mushroom Kingdom newcomers alike. Though its combat and recycled areas leave something to be desired, two decades have done little to dull this game's charisma." —Andy Brown, NME

The Switch sequel to Super Mario Maker isn't just another Mario game, though it does have a campaign mode built in. But the true star of Super Mario Maker 2 is its creation tools, which players can use to build their own 2D Mario platformers and share them with other players online. Or, if you're not that into making stuff, you can download a hypothetically endless amount of user-created levels that can challenge you in all sorts of ways you wouldn't expect from a normal Mario game. While critics tended to greatly enjoy Super Mario Maker 2, there were some minor complaints about its online functions—sharing and downloading levels—being locked entirely behind an Nintendo Online subscription.

"Super Mario Maker 2 is all that the original was and more. The Story Mode feels like a proper campaign, demoing all of the old and new feature and barmy possibilities found in the intuitive level creator. It's a shame that it features some typical Nintendo online stumbles, but it shouldn't be long before that's forgotten in the face of the boundless creativity of the Super Mario Maker community." —Stefan L, TheSixthAxis

After putting out a series of well-regarded Castlevania games, the Metroidvania experts at developer MercurySteam came full circle by putting together this very well liked 2D Metroid title. Metroid Dread doesn't do much to change up the series formula, but maybe that's the point—critics liked this one because it added new wrinkles without making Dread feel unfamiliar in any major way. Those reviewers who wanted more of an evolution of the franchise expressed some disappointment with this one even so, but not so much that it made them dislike the game overall.

"While Metroid Dread sticks a bit too close to a familiar formula, it's still one of the best action games of 2021." —Alessandro Fillari, CNET

The beloved Fire Emblem franchise, which combines turn-based RPG gameplay with a life sim in more recent titles, tried something new in this entry, abandoning its generational gameplay in favor of telling a story with more depth. Players take control of a mercenary who gets stuck in the middle of a war between all the major factions of the continent of Fodlan, and your soldier will determine the fate of the conflict by choosing which faction to support. That shift in focus drew raves from critics, who largely agreed that it was an effective way to shake up the formula.

"It all adds up to a new lease of life for one of Nintendo's younger series, bolstered by revised combat and a gorgeous new look that endows these 3D characters with the grace and style of older games' portrait art. By turns grandiose and silly, but always engrossing, this bubbling school soap opera is a game to spend a summer with." —Edwin Evans-Thirwell, The Guardian

This combo package includes the original Super Mario 3D World more or less as it was when it originally landed on the Wii U in 2013, along with the addition of online co-op and the inclusion of an all-new bonus game, Bowser's Fury. Critics appreciated that this classic platformer was given a proper re-release on a platform people actually own, and they loved Bowser's Fury—though there was some griping about its relatively short length.

"It's the heady energy at the heart of every Super Mario 3D World level, pushed out across an entire map for what's a hugely entertaining, and very different brand of Mario action. There might be more polished Mario adventures around, and more coherent ones. But when it gets to the core of what makes these games so special - the inventiveness, the imagination and the eccentricity of it all - then this new pairing might well be peerless." —Martin Robinson, Eurogamer

The final chapter in a trilogy, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 takes players into a new world, formed by the mysterious merger of the realms of the first two games, which is fighting a war that never ends. The lengthy open-world action-RPG (this is one of those affairs that will last 50+ hours) drew raves from critics for being among the very best JRPG offerings on the Switch, and for its complicated story that followed up on the first two games in surprising ways. Not everyone loved its massive length, but that's a fairly standard objection with games like this one.

"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is the remaster that this respected JRPG deserves, even when it feels like it doesn't go far enough in places. Eight years later, some of its customization systems and an overly grindy structure certainly haven't aged well, but it's story and combat are just as great as ever. The new Future Connected story chapter isn't particularly inspired, but the impressive graphical overhaul and welcome (if small) quality-of-life improvements make this the best version of Xenoblade Chronicles we've ever had." —Travis Northup, IGN

This expanded remaster of the original Wii game, a JRPG with real-time battles set on a planet in which the only bodies of land among the world-spanning ocean are the corpses of two titans, comes with a completely new epilogue, much-improved graphics that are in line with the 2017 sequel, and plenty of quality-of-life changes meant to make the overall experience easier to digest. Critics say the updated version of Xenoblade Chronicles won't change the minds of folks who already don't like these games, but that JRPG fans will have a blast even if certain aspects of this one still feel kinda dated.

The latest Animal Crossing title became an overnight sensation when it launched at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The adorable little social game in which you farm, scavenge, and hang out with animal people hit the spot in a big way in that moment, and New Horizons became one of the best-selling games of all time. Critics responded just like the public to this one, taking refuge in a cozy game that felt like an antidote to what was going on in the world. As a result, this is a game that is difficult to separate from the moment it came from.

"It's a blissfully lighthearted and colourful game filled with charm, humour — I giggled aloud the first time I caught a black bass, described in-game as 'the most metal of all fish' — and a much needed sense of normalcy that comes at a time when we could all use a little pick-me-up." —Chad Sapieha, Post Arcade

Originally a Wii U title, Mario Kart 8's new "Deluxe" version released during the Switch's launch window has been the system's top-selling title to date by a wide margin. While it's largely just an updated version of the same game—it's not a remaster, really—it does include a re-worked version of its battle mode. which allows you to play against other players in various party-style modes. It was that improved version of battle mode, along with various other smaller quality-of-life changes, that led critics to proclaim Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to be the definitive version of an already great game.

"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a refinement rather than a remaster, but one that corrects the few flaws of its predecessor. It would be nice if there was just a bit more new content to help justify the full price release, or if you didn't have to unlock kart mods all over again, but for the foreseeable future, this is the definitive – and best – Mario Kart experience." —Matt Kamen, Wired UK

Nintendo went more than a decade without putting out a proper new 2D side-scrolling Mario title after New Super Mario Bros. U for Wii U. But then came Super Mario Bros. Wonder. And while that may sound pretty traditional, there's a reason it's called Wonder and not New Super Mario Bros 3: This one is all about providing new wrinkles to an old formula. And there's no bigger wrinkle to be found here than the addition of Wonder Flowers, which transform levels into something that is, according to critics, utterly unfamiliar and exciting. What could have been just another little Mario side game instead became something unforgettable.

"Like the Switch itself, Wonder is a collision between the traditional and the new. A game that's the same as it ever was and nothing like Mario has ever been." —Chris Plante, Polygon

Every Nintendo console needs its Smash Bros., and Ultimate is the one that belongs to the Switch. There isn't much about this release that will surprise you if you've played a previous Smash Bros. title, but that's because Nintendo's unique platform fighting game franchise is already very different from every other ongoing fighting game series. And with Ultimate being the top-selling fighting game ever, there's clearly a good rationale for the lack of big changes. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate was as popular with critics as it was with consumers, with the only major complaints being directed at the game's subpar online services.

"It's the best single-player Smash to date, and still retains the fantastic couch co-op the series is known for, but only time will tell if online functionality catches up to the rest of the game." —Jason Faulker, Game Revolution

The most acclaimed of the Switch's remastered titles is Metroid Prime Remastered. It's not the most shocking piece of news, since the original Metroid Prime was already tied for the second-best Metascore of any Nintendo title ever, behind only The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. This remaster takes the first 3D, first-person Metroid game and updates it with a more modern shooter control scheme, as well as massively improving the visuals. The only real complaint from critics is that despite the upgrades, Metroid Prime Remastered is still, at its heart, a game from 2002 with some antiquated design philosophies.

"While the game's design may feel dated (with frequent backtracking, no fast travel, and saving restricted to specific save rooms), Metroid Prime Remastered is still an amazing shooter, and a fantastic puzzle-platformer." —Ivy Winfrey, NPR

After the massive critical and commercial success of Breath of the Wild (which missed this list only because of its simultaneous Wii U release), Nintendo smartly figured it would be a good idea to make a sequel that follows a similar template—one in which Link roams a massive, unstructured open world solving puzzles and parsing mysteries, with an extra focus on survival and crafting gameplay. The result is, according to critics, a bigger, better, and more fleshed-out adventure than that of its predecessor, though folks who weren't so enthralled with Breath of the Wild won't find much to change their minds here.

Note that an updated Switch 2 version of this game is scheduled to be released in June, but TOTK retains its Switch exclusivity for now.

"Tears of the Kingdom builds on its strengths, offering an unmatched adventure with expanded content and improved systems, while still retaining some of its predecessor's flaws. Definitely, don't miss out on this redefined adventure." —Luis Sanchez, LevelUp

This epic visual novel delves into the lengthy history of a haunted mansion that the player character, a spirit with no memory, will need to explore in order to figure out their own backstory. But they aren't exploring in the usual sense; the spirit will need to examine the house's many centuries of history, with four stories spanning 800 years. While The House in Fata Morgana doesn't really have much in the way of "gameplay," that didn't bother critics at all. A good book is a good book, even if it comes in the form of a VN.

Note that a different version of the game was released on other platforms but the Switch version has exclusive content not found in other versions.

"The House in Fata Morgana is over 40 hours long, and in those 40 hours, you'll maybe get to make about three decisions. It is a visual novel in the strictest sense of the word, and you must be prepared for that going in. But with a fantastic, original, slow-burn story about love, loss, hurt, forgiveness, and recovery, it's one of the best visual novels out there — and your patience will be paid off in the end." —Kate Grey, Nintendo Life

Every so often, Nintendo completely changes up its Mario franchise formula in some major new way, and it usually goes pretty well. And that certainly was the case for Super Mario Odyssey, the Switch's 3D Mario title that has Mario solve devilish platforming puzzles across a number of extremely distinct different worlds, including New Donk City, an actual human city full of human NPCs. Critics agreed there's really nothing else like this one, in the Mario franchise or elsewhere, and that it's more fun and enjoyable than pretty much anything else you might choose to play.

"It's a pristine combination of all the directions this company has taken its icon in over the last several decades, cherry-picking the best traits from Mario's many outings—and out into Nintendo's wider oeuvre—and rolling them into an adventure that refuses to quit changing. This is a testament to the company's enduring experimental nature and exacting eye for smart, intuitive game design, but after all these years of largely delivering on that reputation, could we really have expected anything less?" —Matt Gerardi, AV Club
