# What can you do with a modded switch?

I get a lot of customers asking me what they can do with a modded switch, so I thought I would make a post about to to shed some light for them and have a resource for the community.

# \--- Who am I? ---

I own and run So-Cal Console Modding, a board level repair, modding, and customization shop. I have helped many newbies get their switch up and running and have a lot of experience installing modchips, repairing switches, and troubleshooting software for customers.

# General Setup and FAQ

The recommended software setup of a modded switch includes two main boot options. One boots the standard switch firmware and functions like a normal switch including online play (OFW), the other loads custom firmware from your SD card and allows many additional features, but does not let you connect to Nintendo's services if set up properly (CFW EMUMMC).

# Homebrew apps you can install

These are all apps that can be installed on the custom firmware for the switch OS (atmosphere).

1. **Chiaki** - Stream games from your PlayStation 5 to your Nintendo Switch through remote play functionality.
    
2. **DBI** - Over usb, by simply drag and dropping you can: install games, backup/restore saves, backup purchased games, and transfer files. Over wifi via ftp you can install games or browse the sd. Also has tools for deleting cache/orphaned files, syncing the time, removing parental controls, and more.
    
3. **Edison SE** - Game modification tool similar to Cheat Engine that enables editing of basic game values such as points, coins, and experience points in most Switch games.
    
4. **FIZEAU** - Custom color correction and brightness adjustment utility specifically designed for non-OLED Switch models to enhance visual appearance.
    
5. **JKSV** - Game save backup and restore tool (including modified or completed saves found online)

7. **MissionControl** - Controller compatibility tool that enables wireless use of PS5, PS4, Xbox, Wii, and many other controllers on the Switch without requiring additional adapters.
    
8. **Moonlight** - PC-to-Switch game streaming application that works with any GPU (including integrated graphics) when paired with the Sunshine application on PC, not limited to NVIDIA GPUs. Works when on same network as the PC for playing a game while laying in bed for example. Remote streaming works on android.
    
9. **PPSSPP**\- Stand alone PSP Emulator

1. **SYS-CLK** - System overclocking utility that enhances performance for both emulators and Switch games that experience frame rate issues. Can also improve resolution and performance with games that have dynamic resolutions and enable performance necessary to run 60fps mods.
    
2. **SYS DVR** - Gameplay streaming tool that enables USB transmission of Switch gameplay to a PC.
    
3. **Themezer/NXThemes Installer** - Customization utility for installing custom themes and layouts for the Switch home screen and system menus.

# Questions

Solid list. Some programs I would add are,

1. Tinfoil - It allows you install games through USB, LAN, or WAN. You can use public or self hosted shops to install games. It can also install roms and forwarders for use with retroarch so that emulator games show up on your home screen, instead of having to open retroarch and search for a game to open it.
    
2. Switch-NSP-Forwarder - Creates nsp forwarders without needing a PC. You can install NRO apps or retroarch roms on your home screen.
    
3. FTPD Classic - Easily copy files to and from your Switch over WiFi.
    
4. Daybreak - Install system updates
    
5. HB App Store - Browse, install, and update homebrew apps from within the Switch.
