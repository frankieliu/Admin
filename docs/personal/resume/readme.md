suicidal ideation

desperation to end life

suffering

what is that pain

skewed toward the negative

think about one thing is going well

becomes - cutting myself down

reconditioning

habit of thinking negatively
not resourceful
not able to problem solve

let me practice

do the opposite

- wash worries away
- let shower

enjoying things

don't know how to enjoy

makes us stuck in time

do basic things to wake up senses

to restore senses

take it easy -- take what can

be gentle things

- take do something with water

- take a step a time

- read a book
