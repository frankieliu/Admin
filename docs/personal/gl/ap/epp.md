## How it works

Starting from your first day at Apple, you can get EPP discounts on select Apple products and accessories. Also, you can get an In-Store Discount on eligible purchases from an Apple Store. You can use these discounts to purchase products for yourself, family members, and friends. After you’ve worked here for 90 days, you can get the EPP+ credit. This lets you save even more every two years on eligible products.

## EPP+ credit

The EPP+ credit is meant to give you an opportunity to save more — above your Personal and Friends & Family EPP discounts — on one Apple product for yourself every two years.

After you’ve worked at Apple for at least 90 days, you can get the EPP+ credit. To see if you’re eligible, view the [EPP Dashboard](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/epp-dashboard). If you have questions about your EPP+ eligibility, contact People Support.

With the EPP+ credit, you can apply up to US$500 toward one of the following products:

- Mac
- iPad
- iPhone (unlocked)
- Apple Watch
- AirPods Max
- Apple Vision Pro (where available)

If you work outside the U.S., your credit is set at your local currency equivalent using this [exchange rate](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/resource/1101/download) (PDF).

When you purchase an eligible product through the Personal or Friends & Family EPP Store, you can choose to apply the EPP+ credit at checkout. Refurbished products are not eligible for EPP+.

You can use the EPP+ credit with Personal or Friends & Family EPP purchases.

If the cost of the product is less than your EPP+ credit, you forfeit the unused portion of your EPP+ credit. If your EPP+ credit fully covers your discounted product price, the minimum product price charged for EPP+ purchases is US$1 (or a [similar amount in local currency](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/resource/3983/download)).

After you apply the EPP+ credit to a purchase, your next credit is available two years after your date of purchase. These credits don’t add up over time.

## Making a purchase

To get an EPP discount, you need to order online through the Personal or Friends & Family EPP Store. The credit card you use doesn’t need to be in your name. You can ship EPP purchases to any local address you choose, or use Apple Pickup (where available).

Special financing might be available in your country. Look for financing options at store checkout.

If you plan to apply an Apple Gift Card toward an EPP Store purchase, you should not redeem the gift card into your Apple Account (also called Apple ID). Instead, retain the Apple Gift Card, then enter the Apple Gift Card PIN when prompted for payment during checkout on the EPP Store.

If you use Apple Card, you get 3% Daily Cash back on EPP purchases. At this time, the Apple Card Monthly Installments payment option isn’t available on the EPP Store. To learn more about Apple Card, visit [apple.com](https://www.apple.com/apple-card/).

### If you need a fapiao

As an employee, you can also get a commercial fapiao for EPP purchases. But because these products are meant for personal use only, you can’t have a company name in the header.

Allow up to 1–2 business days after you pay to get system updates and payment notifications. If it’s been longer than that, contact China Online Service Contact Center at 400 666 8800.

### If you need an invoice

Full-form tax invoices are only issued, on request, in the name of the purchasing individual.

## Making a purchase

If your work location is in IndonesiaEgyptRomaniaUkraineNigeriaIsraelLithuaniaGreeceColombiaSaudi ArabiaSouth Africa, you need to first purchase eligible products at the regular retail price. This should be from an authorized Apple reseller in your country. Then you can get reimbursed for the discount.

If your work location is in India, you need to first purchase eligible products at the full retail price. These are your options:

- For Personal EPP or Friends & Family EPP discounts, you need to purchase from the [Apple Store online](https://www.apple.com/in/shop) in India. The Apple Store online ships products to most India pincodes.
- For the In-Store Discount, you can purchase from an Apple Retail Store in India (only India team members are eligible). For locations, visit [Apple Retail Stores](https://www.apple.com/retail/).

The only exceptions are eligible Hermès accessories for Apple products, which may be purchased from an Apple Authorized Reseller in India. [Find a list of Apple Authorized Resellers](https://locate.apple.com/choose-country-region).

After you make the purchase, you can submit your receipt to get reimbursed for the discount.

You will not get reimbursed if your receipt shows a discount or promotion already applied to the purchase — such as No Cost or Low Cost Equated Monthly Installments (EMI), free AirPods bundle, or Education discount. Purchases with Bank Cashback or Trade In are eligible for EPP reimbursement. Discounts are not available on third-party accessories.

You may not use EPP for purchases by a business or for business purposes. Make sure the name on the receipt is for you, your friend, or your family member, not for a business.

If your work location is in Vietnam, you need to first purchase eligible products at the regular retail price. This should be from the [Apple Store online](https://www.apple.com/vn/shop) in Vietnam.

If your work location is in Macau, you need to purchase an eligible product from Apple Galaxy Macau or Apple Cotai Strip at the regular retail price. Then you can get reimbursed for the discount.

Note: Receipts from outside your local country will not be accepted.

To get reimbursed:

1. Sign in to the [Apple Benefits Portal](https://ssl2.perquisite.net/RewardCentre/sso/InitiateSAML2/3282c29a-a50d-4adb-8df2-dcdece026601?idp=1).
2. Choose Reimbursements > Make a Claim.
3. Fill in the details about the product you purchased.
4. If you’re reimbursing the EPP+ credit, choose EPP+.
5. Attach your purchase receipt.

All EPP and EPP+ reimbursements are final.

### Submit separate claims

You need to submit a separate claim for each eligible product that you want to get reimbursed, even if there’s more than one product on your receipt. Just attach the same receipt to each product claim.

To claim AppleCare or AppleCare+, you need to purchase the service together with the product. You cannot claim AppleCare or AppleCare+ separately if you decide to purchase at a later date.

### When to submit your claim

Your receipts need to be dated within the current EPP program year. If you make an EPP purchase in December, be sure to claim it by the end of January the next year.

When submitting an EPP+ claim, if the cost of the product minus the EPP discount is less than your EPP+ credit, you forfeit the unused portion of your EPP+ credit.

If you’re a new hire submitting an EPP+ claim, the purchase receipt must be at least 90 days after your start date.

### When to expect reimbursement

The reimbursement for EPP and EPP+ claims will be processed in your payslip. Depending on the date of claim submission and date of claim approval, it can take up to one to two pay cycles to see your reimbursement appear on your payslip.

For more information on the pay schedule, see [How Your Pay Works](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/subtopic/125). For an example of how EPP reimbursement appears on your payslip, see [Understanding your pay](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/page/269).

### See your history

To see your EPP claims and reimbursement history, use the [Apple Benefits Portal](https://ssl2.perquisite.net/RewardCentre/sso/InitiateSAML2/3282c29a-a50d-4adb-8df2-dcdece026601?idp=1). You’ll also see your EPP Store purchases listed there.

### If you work in Macau

You can get a 10 percent discount on up to 30 third-party accessories per calendar year that you purchase at Apple Galaxy Macau or Apple Cotai Strip. You get the discount right when you purchase them in the store. These purchases aren’t eligible for the EPP reimbursement claim process.

With the EPP Dashboard, you can conveniently see how many Personal and Friends & Family discounts you have remaining for the calendar year. You can also check your EPP+ eligibility. Total EPP purchase limits include your purchases made using the Apple Benefits Portal reimbursement process as well as your purchases from EPP Stores in other countries. [View the EPP Dashboard](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/epp-dashboard).

## Buying for friends and family outside your country

If your friends or family live outside your home country, you can make an EPP purchase for them in two ways.

**Option 1: If the location has an EPP Store, order through that EPP Store**

To get there:

1. Use the location selector at the bottom of this page to change your view to their country or region’s People site. (If you don’t see the location, you may need to change the organization first.)
2. Select a Store link under the “How it works” section above.

To make the purchase, you need an appropriate payment method and local shipping address, or you can use Apple Pickup (where available).

**Option 2: If the location doesn’t have an EPP Store, get the product first through your EPP Store**

This is an option if your friends or family live in a country or region that doesn’t have an EPP Store, or if you don’t have an appropriate local payment method. You can purchase the product from the EPP Store in your location. Then either have it shipped to you first or use Apple Pickup (where available). When you get the product, you can ship it to your friend or family member at your own expense. Just make sure that shipping to them follows the [Apple Export Compliance policy](https://exportsandsanctions.apple.com/export-compliance/).

Some EPP Stores let you use credit cards and billing addresses from other countries. For details, see the billing options at checkout. For EPP Stores that don’t support cross-border billing, you can use the shipping address as the billing address.

For more about availability, shipping, and delivery, see the specific country or region’s EPP policy on the People site and the EPP Store.

## Buying for friends and family outside your country

If your friends or family live outside your home country, you can make an EPP purchase for them by ordering the product from the EPP Store in their country. To get there:

- Use the location selector at the top of this page to switch to their country’s People site.
- Choose a Store link under the “How it works” section above.

To make the purchase, you need an appropriate payment method and local shipping address in that country, or you can use Apple Pickup (where available).

Some EPP Stores let you use credit cards and billing addresses from other countries. For details, see the billing country options at checkout. For EPP Stores that don’t support cross-border billing, you can use the shipping address as the billing address.

For more about availability, shipping, and delivery, see the specific country’s EPP policy on the People site and the EPP Store.

## Product availability

You can usually get new products through the EPP Store right when they’re released to the public. While Apple tries to have products available to employees at launch, availability is sometimes delayed. EPP prices and product availability are subject to change without notice.

If Apple sells out of a product you order, your order will be canceled. You can then use your discount (and EPP+ credit, if applicable) for something else.

## Returns

Your EPP purchases are subject to the same return policies as consumer purchases from Apple. For more information, see the [Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/at/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy (Dutch)](https://www.apple.com/be-nl/shop/browse/open/salespolicies) or [Apple Sales and Refund Policy (French)](https://www.apple.com/be-fr/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/br/shop/open/salespolicies#topic-17)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://epp.apple.com/cn_epp_5005111/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/cz/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/dk/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/fi/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/de/shop/browse/open/salespolicies) [Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://epp.apple.com/hk_epp_40884/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/hu/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/it/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/jp/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/kr/shop/browse/open/salespolicies) [Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/lu/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/my/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/mx/shop/help/returns_refund)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/nz/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/no/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/ph/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/pl/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/pt/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/ru/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/sg/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/es/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/se/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy (French)](https://www.apple.com/ch-fr/shop/browse/open/salespolicies) or [Apple Sales and Refund Policy (German)](https://www.apple.com/ch-de/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/tw/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/th-en/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/tr/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/ae/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/browse/open/salespolicies)[Apple Sales and Refund Policy](https://www.apple.com/shop/browse/open/salespolicies) in the country where you’re making the purchase.

For countries that accept returns and exchanges, note that you can’t exchange products that you purchased through the EPP Store. But you can return the original product first, and then purchase the new product.

If you purchased Apple Vision Pro on EPP, you can exchange included accessories (such as the Light Seal, Solo Knit Band, or Dual Loop Band) for a different size if the item you received doesn’t fit as expected. To find simple fixes for common fit issues, visit [Apple Vision Pro Fit Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/117730).

When you cancel or return a product, your EPP quantity limit resets within two to four days. And if you used your EPP+ credit, your EPP+ eligibility also resets within two to four days. If your EPP quantity limit or EPP+ eligibility has not reset within four days, contact [Resets](mailto:emeia_epp@apple.com)[Resets](mailto:direct_epp@apple.com)[Resets](mailto:gc_epp_cn@apple.com)[Resets](mailto:rpac_epp_ov_ja@apple.com)[Resets](mailto:rpac_epp_en@apple.com). If your EPP quantity limit or EPP+ eligibility has not reset within four days, contact [People Support](https://hcl.apple.com/peoplesupport?cat_id=f80a7af3a36ee450389d3f0807ef6415&id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=632b2e3e94cee0109e88a8584e0d850f).

## Price protection and warranties

Standard price protection guidelines and product warranties apply to all EPP purchases. You can also purchase AppleCare extended service and support. The AppleCare Protection Plan and AppleCare+ give you up to two or three years of service and support. For country availability and product details, visit [AppleCare Products](https://www.apple.com/support/products/).

## Taxes

Depending on where you live, you might have to pay taxes on your EPP discount, In-Store Discount, or EPP+ credit. If so, Apple pays the applicable payroll tax withholdings for you on anything you buy through the EPP Store.

The discount and applicable taxes are generally processed and visible on your pay statement quarterly — each March, June, September, and December. The amounts processed are for the prior three months’ purchases. For example, in March you’ll see the discount and taxes for purchases made in December, January, and February.

The discount and applicable taxes for purchases made throughout the year are processed and visible on your pay statement in December.

The discount and applicable taxes are generally processed annually in April.

Based on Fair Market Value rules, discounts up to 30 percent are treated as tax-free. This means that most EPP discounts are tax-free, while the EPP+ credit is usually taxed. Learn moreExpand

Though most EPP discounts are less than 30 percent, taxes are generally applied on most EPP+ purchases. That’s because the EPP+ credit combined with the Personal or Friends & Family discount is more than 30 percent. Taxes are also applied on QPromo purchases when the discount is more than 30 percent. In these cases, your taxable benefit will be processed through Payroll each quarter. You’ll see a line on your paycheck for Special Product Credit — once, as a payment under code EPPW for the amount of the discount plus the taxes due, and again, as a deduction under code 40SP for the amount of the discount. These line items indicate that your net pay isn’t impacted.

Employees aren’t eligible for VAT Fapiao. The EPP purchase discount is a taxable employment benefit under the China Individual Income Tax laws. Apple pays these taxes for you.

## Purchase terms and conditions

EPP purchases are intended for your personal use or for your friends or family.

- You cannot resell products for a profit within one year of the purchase date.
- If you purchase products for friends or family, you can only accept reimbursement up to the exact amount of the purchase.
- You cannot sell products to any Apple reseller.
- You must be able to account for all equipment for one year from the date of purchase.

EPP privileges (including EPP+) aren’t transferable. You cannot transfer your EPP benefits to another employee and you cannot use another employee’s EPP benefits.

EPP purchases may be monitored and audited. Failure to comply with EPP policies or abuse of purchasing privileges may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

If your product donation is made to an eligible cause under the Apple Matching Gifts Program, it may be eligible for a matching monetary gift from Apple (up to the annual limit). For more information, see [Apple Matching Gifts Program](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/subtopic/133).

[How can I use the In-Store Discount in my home country or while traveling?](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/subtopic/12#)

When you visit an Apple Store, you can save on most products with the In-Store Discount. In most locations, you can get the discount by simply presenting your ID and your [Employee In-Store Discount Code](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/in-store-discount).

If you’re in a region that doesn’t accept the Employee In-Store Discount Code, you might be asked for your name and Apple badge number instead. Check with an Apple Store team member when you arrive to guide you through the process.

While you can use the In-Store Discount for yourself, family members, or friends, you must be present in the Apple Store to make the purchase. Also, be aware of the product limits and terms and conditions outlined on this page.

If you’re traveling in India, the Employee In-Store Discount is not available.

[I’m eligible for a discount on Apple products through another program (such as Education). Can I combine this discount with the EPP discount?](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/subtopic/12#)

You can’t combine other Apple discounts with the EPP discount as these are separate discount programs. You’ll need to choose which discount is the best option for you and follow the instructions for that program.

[Why is Apple Music or Apple Service showing as a deduction on my latest paystub?](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/subtopic/12#)

If you’ve redeemed an Apple Fitness+ promotional offer code (whether or not you’ve activated it), you may see “Apple Service” or “Apple Music” and the 12-month value of Apple Fitness+ on your paycheck, generally the month following your code request. The applicable taxes will be itemized on your pay statement.

For more information, visit [Fitness+ for Employees](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/Fitnessplus).

[I recently bought Apple products through the Employee Purchase Plan.](https://people.apple.com/cupertino/en/subtopic/12#)

When you get discounts on Apple products through EPP, EPP+, or In-Store purchases, these discounts are a taxable benefit. Apple pays the applicable taxes for you. For details, see these sections of your Earnings Statement.

### Earnings

Product Discount T under Earnings shows the amount of tax that Apple paid for you.

### Other Benefits and Information

Product Discount under Other Benefits and Information shows the value of the discount you got for your purchase. This amount is included in your taxable wages and increases your total wages. As a result, you’ll need to pay more taxes. But don’t worry, Apple pays the taxes for you.
