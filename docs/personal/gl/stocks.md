Tl;dr: Some of your Google Stock Units (GSUs) have vested. If you are participating in an Employee Trading Plan (ETP), any shares from this vesting that are enrolled will be sold one trading day after the vesting event. Click here to opt out of these GSU vesting email notifications.

Dear Googler,

Some of your GSUs have vested! You will see your shares (net shares deposited after shares withheld for taxes) and details of your GSU vesting in your Schwab account on 29-Sep-25 at 12:00pm PT. No action is needed from you to receive the shares; visit this page on how to view them on your broker account.

Equity Taxes

GSU vesting is a taxable event and Google is required to withhold taxes immediately when your GSUs vest, which it does by withholding shares. The value of the GSUs at vesting (your equity vesting income) and the taxes withheld will be reported on your payslip. Visit go/gsutaxes for more information.
