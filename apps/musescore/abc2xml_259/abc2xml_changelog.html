	* Revision: 259
	- update documentation
	- new function scanEdo scans all accidentals and sets the temperament to edo12
	or edo53. The result can be overridden with %%MIDI tempermentequal 36
	- translate fractional accidentals with denumerator 3 as up/down accidentals
	(for files with accidentals from both edo36 and edo53, as created by xml2abc
	--temp=2)

	* Revision: 258
	- this version also replaces ^8 and _8, for which no superscripted versions
	exist, by notes with equivalent pitch, lowering or raising the nearest step
	with one comma.

	* Revision: 257
	- new option --mus53 that replaces Arel-Ezgi accidentals by superscripted
	normal ones. The superscriped accidentals appear to be played at the correct
	pitch by musescore. Also, this option adds explicit notated accidentals to
	each and every note that was altered, either by the key or by a previous
	alteration in the same measure. This is necessary because musescore ignores
	the normal accidental rules for all microtonal accidentals, whether
	temporary or in the key.

	* Revision: 256
	- bug: chords or annotations with spaces caused beam break when between
	beamed notes
	- bug: do not sort explicit key alterations
	- added makam abc files for edo36 and edo53 to the regression set

2025-04-13

	* Revision: 255
	- seach for "%%MIDI termperamentequal nn" to determine the tuning
	- change accTab to several tuning mappings
	- MusicXml.edo variable stores the tuning identification
	- change getAlter and getAcc to accommodate multiple tunings
	- add abc2xml to software identification

2025-03-06

	* Revision: 254
	- added global s.nid that holds the current ABC note for better error
	messages
	- changed global dicts into access functions: s.getAcc, s.getAlter with error
	messages
	- moved decTupAcc into classMusicXml for better error messages with s.nid
	- included __ and ^^ in regex for alterations for K:

2025-03-05

	* Revision: 253
	- small change in alterAction with respect to the effect of slashes
	- removed redundant brackets from regex "altre" (in doFields, K:)

2025-03-04

	* Revision: 252
	- new partial grammer for accidental list (for K:)
	- new function decTupAcc() to decode parsed microtonal accidentals
	- added microtonal accidentals to alterTab and accTab
	- key alterations and temporary alterations are remembered as accidentals and
	not als alterations (alter =&gt; acc in msreAlts and keyAlts)
	- scan K: for microtonal accidentals with new partial grammer
	- update generation of &lt;key&gt; element with explicit accidentals and alterations

2025-03-02

	* Revision: 251
	- key alterations not reset on each voice when the header K: has no key

2025-02-28

	* Revision: 250
	- add sharp, sharp-sharp, flat, flat-flat to accTab
	- add corresponring accidentals _5, _9, ^4, ^9 to alterTab
	- in function parse (): initialize attrmap ['K'] with pObj
	- improve parsing of key field: allow key 'none', allow any word (except a
	clef name) as mode for the tonic, but only valid mode names are translated

2025-02-26

	* Revision: 249
	- added parsing grammer for K: (including microtonal accidentals)
	- new function decTupAcc() to decode microtonal accidentals
	- added definitions in alterTab and accTab
	- changed representation in msreAlts and keyAlts: accidentals replace
	alteration values
	- changed key processing in doFields to deal with the new parse results of K:
	- corrected the list of key-octave elements

2025-02-22

	* Revision: 248
	- the alterAction always results in a tuple as parse result
	- all places where an accidental is used have to unpack the tuple
	- the default value of an optional accidental is also a tuple (in percmap
	grammer)

	* Revision: 247
	abc2xml.py:
	- add parsing of fractional accidentals (microtonal accidentals). The parse
	result of a normal accidental remains unchanged. For fractional accidentals
	the parse result is a tuple (accidental, fraction) parseOnlyTest.py:
	- move alterAction before leaveWhiteSpace in percmap grammer
	- make alterAction identical to the one in abc2xml.py
	- added percmap test

2025-02-21

	* Revision: 246
	- updated parseOnlyTest to latest parser

2024-08-13

	* Revision: 245
	- again corrected an escape sequence, this time in pyparsing (always printed
	syntax warning since python 3.12)

2024-05-02

	* Revision: 244
	- corrected escape sequences that caused deprecation warnings (and syntax
	warnings as of python 3.12)

2024-04-11

	* Revision: 243
	- updated compile/distribute script to Py3

2024-04-10

	* Revision: 242
	- implement !rbstop!, meaning: the current started volta will be stopped at
	the next bar line (limitation of MusicXML)

	* Revision: 241
	- bug: incorrect parsing of tilde in lyrics (reported by Gáspár Erdélyi)

2024-02-11

	* Revision: 240
	- initial-scale bug
