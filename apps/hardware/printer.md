# Toner for Brother HL-L2360DW 

I am looking for the proper steps to reset a Brother HL-L2360DW toner light.

Troubleshooting
I can find the steps for all kinds of other models, but not the 2260. A new toner cartridge does not reset the light and I have been scouring the internet looking for the proper steps. I figure if anyone can help its reddit. If anyone knows the steps if you would be so kind as to share them with me I would really appreciate it.

I physically made it to the printers and did the live chat help with brother, here are those steps in case anyone else runs into that problem.

With the cover open, please power off the machine by pressing the power button (located on the top left side of the machine above the WiFi button) until 'Shutting Down' is displayed or the LCD is blank.

Once the machine has powered off completely, press and hold the GO button while powering on the printer.

Release the GO button. 'Users Mode' will show on the display.

Press the GO button 9 times. The WiFi button will blink each time the GO button is pressed.

Close the front cover.

Press the GO button 3 times. After a short pause the display will show 'Please wait'.

Verify 'Replace Toner', 'Toner Low', or 'Toner Ended' does not appear on the display after machine warms up.
