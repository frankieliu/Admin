What is the default user name and password for my Brother network card, BRAdmin, Remote Setup or Web Based Management?

Some functions, such as Web Based Management, offer password access for both Users and Administrators. 
The default user name and password for each level of access is as follows:

USER:
User name: user
Password: access

ADMINISTRATOR:
User name: admin
Password: access
