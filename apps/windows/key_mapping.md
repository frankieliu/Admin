# apple keyboard

Apple keyboard does not have insert print pause

1. use power toys  win/power toys
2. go to input/output - keyboard manager
3. remap key
4. right win to right option
5. right option to right win
6. f13 to ins
7. f14 to prt scr
8. f15 to pause break

Since there is no ins, prt scr and pause break:

1. use settings (win + i)/accessibility/on screen keyboard
2. this should allow you to have access to ins/prt/pau
