<!-- **Simple C&C Solo Rules**  
  
Richard Borg recently updated his [Power of Three Solo Rules \[1 Feb 2021\]](https://gmtwebsiteassets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ccn/2-1-21UpdatedSoloNapoleonicsupdate.pdf) for [Commands & Colors: Napoleonics](https://videogamegeek.com/boardgame/62222/commands-and-colors-napoleonics) and posted them on the GMT games website.  
  
**In his introduction Richard says:**  
“The Power of Three rules were created to allow one player to still enjoy their own copy of the Commands & Colors Napoleonics board game. Perhaps like you, I recently have found myself having to play many games solo. Which is the big reason for this updated solo version with a little more detail and explanation.”  
  
**My Take:**  
It is a good read and goes into some detail of using the system to play Commands & Colors: Napoleonics.  
I Liked the simple elegance of the rules and tried them out with great success.  
  
Then it occurred to me that as all of Richard’s Commands & Colors titles have similar Command Cards and the same mechanics of play, it follows then that his “Power of Three Solo Rules” should be compatible with all of the Commands & Colors titles.  
  
To put this theory to the test I tried and successfully used the “Power of Three” Rules to play remarkably enjoyable solo games of Battlecry, Memoir, The Great War, Tricorne and BattleLore (1st Edition).  
  
In the process I have made a few slight changes in order to accommodate the differences, streamline play across all titles and accommodate Vassal play.

**Simple C&C Solo**  
Richard Borg’s original Rules are linked above, here I present my play tested adaptation of those rules as a generic C&C Solo method:  
  
\- Setup the scenario as per the instructions but do not deal any cards.  
  
\- Note the intended hand size for each side. This is the number used when a command card refers to “the number of cards held in your hand including this card” or similar wording.  
  
\- Draw 3 cards into the Starting sides Hand.  
  
\- Choose one and Discard it, then Choose one to Play as the command for the turn.  
  
\- The Remaining card stays in the hand and is carried over to the next turn, allowing for continuity and forward planning.  
  
\- Place the remaining card face down (or Close the player hand).  
  
\- The Second player now follows the same 3 steps of Draw, Discard and Play.  
  
\- Both sides will now have one card each in their hand at the start of the next turn and Play continues as normal, alternating turns.  
  
\- Each side will begin the turn by drawing the hand back up to 3 cards before discarding one, playing one and holding one.  
  
**Special cases**  
  
Certain cards require Slightly different handling than the normal card text instructs and are played as follows:  
  
**Scout / Probe** - Play the card as normal then:  
  
\- Draw two cards, choose one and discard one.  
  
\- The side will now end its turn holding two cards not one.  
  
\- Draw two cards as normal in the next turn so that the hand size is Four  
  
\- Discard Two cards rather than One  
  
\- Play one card and end the turn with One card as normal.  
  
**Ambush / First Strike / Fight Back** - This card is played immediately and then discarded, it may NOT be held.  
  
\- Issue an order to any one unit of your choice that is adjacent to an enemy unit. That unit may battle, but not move, and it may not Take Ground, persue or Overrun even if the enemy unit vacates the hex.  
  
\- The Card is then discarded.  
  
\- If no unit is eligible then the card must be discarded unplayed.  
  
\- This is a **bonus attack** that replaces the discard phase.  
  
\- You may now choose one of the remaining cards to play as normal to finish the turn, but the unit that made the Bonus attack may not Battle again this turn.  
  
**Thoughts on hand size:** An optional rule, for scenarios with unbalanced hand sizes.  
  
\- If the difference in hand size is Two or more cards the player with the larger hand size may hold Two cards, not one, at the end of each turn and may build the hand up to Four cards not Three.  
  
\- Discard One, Play One and Keep Two.  
  
**Additional Card Decks**  
  
I have not tried any of the games with additional card sets such as Tactician Cards, Lore Cards, Combat Cards etc but Richard gives some guidelines in his [“Power of Three Solo Rules”](https://gmtwebsiteassets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ccn/2-1-21UpdatedSoloNapoleonicsupdate.pdf) that may be used as a starting point in other games.  
  
I would suggest that Ambush style cards be played immediately as described above or discarded.  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
This rule summary encompasses the “Power of Three Solo Rules” and applies them to the Commands and Colors Family of games as a whole.  
  
It is a simple set of rules that allows for solo play with no additional setup or components, it plays fast and still provides some sense of planning for the next turn and, as Richard said, “adding 2 new cards for the next turn can change one’s plans.”  
  
Having played several games solo by switching sides and playing both hands and with various Solo House Rules or the CDG Solo method, and, in comparison to the “Power of Three Solo Rules”, I much prefer the latter.  
  
Whilst there were very few positives as a result of Covid, Richards contribution of a Solo System for Commands and Colors is definitely one of them.  
  
I like them for their simplicity, elegance and speed of play.  
Give them a try, I think that you will too.  
  
Cheers
