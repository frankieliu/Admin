# probe

ffprobe -i "m3u8_file.m3u8"

There you should find an audio and a video stream, if there is a subtitle one then you can get that one too.

# choose a particular video stream

ffmpeg -i "input_file.m3u8" -map 0:12 -c:v copy -map 0:0 -c:a copy "output.mp4"

-map 0:12

0: means which input, since you only have one input from -i "input_file.m3u8" it is the first index

12: means which stream from the input file, note that this is the same as the one from ffprobe above

-c:v copy: means select the video codec, in this case we just copy it

-c:a copy: means select the audio codec, in this case we just copy it
