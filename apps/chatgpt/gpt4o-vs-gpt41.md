# The Verdict for Coding
- Choose GPT-4.1 (or its mini/nano variants via API/Playground): For deep work, fixing bugs, complex refactoring, or tasks where accuracy and instruction following are paramount. 
- Choose GPT-4o: For fast brainstorming, simple code snippets, quick text-based interactions, or when cost/speed is more critical than perfect accuracy on complex tasks.
