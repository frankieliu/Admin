To configure the Openbox menu in Lubuntu, you'll primarily modify the menu.xml file. For a single user, you can edit the file in your home directory at ~/.config/openbox/menu.xml. For a system-wide configuration that applies to new users, you'll edit the file in /etc/xdg/openbox/menu.xml according to an Ask Ubuntu thread. You can use a text editor like gedit or nano to make changes, and you'll likely need to restart Openbox or the session for changes to take effect.
